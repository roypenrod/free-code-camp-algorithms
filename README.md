I'm working my way through Free Code Camp.

Free Code Camp challenges you to learn full-stack JavaScript development while building web apps for non-profit organizations.

You can check out Free Code Camp at http://www.freecodecamp.com

These are my solutions to the algorithm challenges (FCC calls them "Bonfires").

I'm sharing these as a coding sample for my portfolio.

If you want to reach me, you can find my contact info in my Github profile or visit my website at: www.roypenrod.com
